![](kfkejdgfee.png)
## [Bot 100% Marked Video and Reading Module]

This Python script automates interactions with Coursera courses, including marking videos and readings as completed, and navigating through course content. It supports **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)** usage on GitHub and uses Selenium for browser automation.

## Features
- **Automated Login**: Login manually once and save cookies for future sessions.
- **Course Navigation**: Automatically navigate through course modules, video, and mark items as completed.
- **Quiz Handling**: The `quiz.py` and `quizeng.py` scripts attempt to handle quizzes automatically using various methods.
- **Multi-course Support**: Process multiple courses simultaneously by inputting an array of course links.
- **Hotkey Integration**: Use `Ctrl + C` to stop the automation loop.
